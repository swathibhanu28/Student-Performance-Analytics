# Student Performance Analytics

## Overview
This project analyzes student academic performance using **MySQL** for data storage and **Power BI** for visualization.  
The goal is to derive meaningful insights such as department-wise performance, student strength, and top performers.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- MySQL
- Power BI
- SQL
- GitHub

## SQL Breakdown
The SQL logic is organized progressively to demonstrate learning and query complexity:

- **01_schema.sql**  
  Database and table creation (students, courses, enrollments)

- **02_basic_queries.sql**  
  Basic SELECT and WHERE queries

- **03_aggregation_queries.sql**  
  GROUP BY, COUNT, and AVG queries for analysis

- **04_join_queries.sql**  
  Multi-table JOIN queries for relational analysis

- **05_subqueries.sql**  
  Advanced subquery-based analysis such as:
  - Students above average CGPA
  - Top CGPA student per department

---

## Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard is built using MySQL data and includes:

- Average CGPA by department
- Student count by department
- Top performing students
- Interactive department slicer

The dashboard uses proper data modeling with relationships between fact and dimension tables.

---

## Key Insights
- Department-wise academic performance comparison
- Impact of student count on average CGPA
- Identification of top-performing students
- Interactive analysis using filters and slicers

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL querying (basic to advanced)
- Data modeling and relationships
- Power BI visualization and dashboard design
- Analytical and business-oriented thinking
